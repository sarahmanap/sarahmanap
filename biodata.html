<p>Next, I will tell you about my family. My father's name is <strong>Abdul Manap bin Hasan</strong> while my mother is <strong>Haslina binti Hussain</strong> and a housewife. I have two brothers which are <em>Mohd Amirul Naim</em> and <em>Ahmad Ryan Shah</em>. </p>

<p>I have many hobbies but the one I like the most is watching dramas. I usually watched korean dramas because they can make me happy. But sometimes I will also find some time to read a novel. I like to eat <em>Nasi Goreng Pattaya</em> and <em>Teh O Ais</em>. </p>
